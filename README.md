Data Science Nano Degree at the Udacity platform. I hope to learn a lot about all the possible areas a Data Scientist can work, aswell as the necessary tools/skills that are required or desirable to help me grow in this career.

### This is the repository I will use for the future projects and exercises that I will be working throughout the course.
